This example demonstrates a common error in VBScript related to implicit data type coercion.  The function `MyFunction` lacks explicit variable type declarations, which can lead to unexpected results if the input parameters (`param1`, `param2`) are of different data types.  The solution shows how to declare explicit data types to avoid this problem and improve code clarity and reliability.
